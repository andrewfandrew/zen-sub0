A Drupal 7 Zen subtheme This subtheme will illustrate some of the ways that a basic theme like zen can be customised.
The goal is to provide a zen subtheme ready for production use or perhaps for staging environment. The emphasis is on
a subtheme that will be useful and interesting, rather than one that just demonstrates customisation techniques.

To use this repo, clone the lastest version of drupal 7 to your development box/ system. You will need a LAMP stack
installed and configured on your dev box. Follow instructions for setting up a drupal 7 site. Ideally install drush
and you will need to install git.

Then, go to the drupal zen theme website and download 7.x-3.x-dev version of zen to sites/all/themes directory
of your drupal 7 installation. This project is based on tutorials in a book, 'Drupal 7 Cookbook' which you can access
on Safari Books. You will find instructions there on how to set up a zen subtheme. It involves copying the STARTERKIT
from inside zen directory to sites/all/themes. My own zen subtheme, named myzen will not be a close copy of the myzen 
created in that book, but it will be based on it.

The myzen directory should be copied into sites/all/themes 
and the zen theme also needs to present in that directory
so that the myzen subtheme can inherit zen settings
